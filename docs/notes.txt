OctNet: Learning Deep 3D Representations at High Resolutions:
  * Andreas Geiger, November 2016
  - Using our OctNet, we investigate the impact of high resolution in- puts wrt.
  accuracy on the three tasks and demonstrate that higher resolutions are
  particularly beneficial for orientation estimation and semantic point cloud
  labeling. (128^3 and above)

Large-Scale Shape Retrieval with Sparse 3D Convolutional Neural Networks:
  * Evgeny Burnaev, July 2017
  - Adding a third spatial dimension in the input grid correspondingly increases
   computational costs. Num- ber of cells scales as a power of three w.r.t. the
   resolution of the voxel grid. Low resolution grids make it difficult to
   differentiate between similar shapes, and lose some of the fine details
   available in 2D renderings of equivalent resolution.
   - Computational complexity of 3D convolution for image with dimensions of
   N × M × K with filters sizes of n × m × k is equal to O(NMKnmk)
