Protein Structure PDB To Encoded 2D Image Work Flow:

1. GenerateCurves.py
      -> Generate 2D and 3D curves
  Output:
      - *_3d.npz
      - *_2d.npz

2. ProcessPDBs.py
      -> Parse PDB coordinate data
      -> Calculate rotation matricies
      -> Generate rotation permutations
      -> Calculate applied rotations
      -> Save processed data file
  Output:
      - processed_pbs.npz
      - curve_3d.npz
      - curve_2d.npz

3. EncodePDBs.py
      -> Read processed data file
      -> For each entry:
        -> For each channel:
          -> Generate mesh from coordinate data
          -> Voxelize mesh
          -> 3D to 1D dimension reduction using space filling curve
          -> 1D to 2D dimension recasting using space filling curve
        -> Append channels
        -> Save encoded 2D image
  Output:
      - images_folder/*.png
