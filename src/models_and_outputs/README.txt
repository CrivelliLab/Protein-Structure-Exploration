Note:

The following folders contain code that is deprecated and broken. This code was
used to generate the model outputs in these folders but was done before the
massive directory restructuring took place. In order to reproduce the network
runs that relied on the code in these folders the python scripts located in the
network definitions subdirectories will have to be modified. If that is desired
then the better option would be to use a new version of the network files and
simply update the pameters as needed. 

DIRECTORIES CONTAINING BROKEN CODE HAVE "CODE-BROKEN" APPENDED TO THEIR NAME.
